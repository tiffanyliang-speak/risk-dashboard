**Overall Release Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**
• Multiple critical user flow fixes (AI lessons blank screens, speaking cards race conditions) combined with significant UI redesigns and bottom sheet refactoring create elevated risk. The high volume of changes (134 files) across core lesson experiences requires thorough validation.

**P0 — Top QA Focus Areas (Must Test)**
• **SCO-545**: AI lesson blank screen fix - test all AI lesson completion flows and navigation paths to ensure no regressions in lesson transitions
• **VOICE-827**: Speaking cards race condition fix - validate speaking card functionality under various network conditions and rapid user interactions
• **LSN-2102**: AI lesson bottom sheet problems fix - test all bottom sheet interactions in AI lessons including edge cases and orientation changes
• **NUX-1844**: Community publish UI update - verify complete publish flow functionality and visual consistency across all screen states
• **NUX-1874**: Favorites screen redesign - test full favorites functionality including add/remove operations and navigation flows

**Other Notable Changes**
• Multiple Learning Path tooltip changes (LP-3350, LP-3373, LP-3359) touching same feature area increases regression risk
• Significant AI lesson UI refactoring with new components (HintCorrectionContainer, StaticSubtitle) needs comprehensive testing
• GROW-2825 streak calendar logic changes for short streaks could affect streak calculations
• Multiple dependency updates including LiveKit, Room database, and Android Gradle Plugin

**No Code Changes (Zero Risk)**
• Version updates, localization updates from Lokalise, open source license dark mode fix, database cleanup of unused vocabProficiency field
